# Arôloram, Underworld

> Once a dwarf reaches the riches of deep darkness, they never want to

This is a very dark color scheme. All craftsdwarfship is of the highest
quality. It is composed of 16 colors based in the golden ratio, whose 8 are
grayscale and other 8 are *colorful* ones.

## Philosophy

- The dark is cozy, and therefore, must be the lair of the eyes.
  - The background colors are the darkest possible.
- The colors must be distributed evenly across the spectrum.
  - The HUE variation of a color and its neighbor is always 45°.
  - A side effect of this is that every color has its complement.
- The colors must not strike the eyes.
  - All foreground colors have the same lightness.
- Similar colors must mean similar things.
  - Recognition of visual elements becomes easier.

the editor using this color scheme. This color scheme will better fit if you
already has a dark environment.
